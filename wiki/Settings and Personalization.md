## Change Day Start Time

```
today -T [time]
```

`-T` changes the start time of your day. time tells *today* the time to change to. For example, if you want your day to start at 5 in the morning then you can run: `today -T 5:00`. If you are an night owl and want your day to start at 17:00, `today -T 17:00`.

## Configure Settings

```
today --conf
```

`--conf` will run the settings configuration function. In there, you can change the time the day starts, the default name for task and the default duration for task.

## Change Theme

```
today --theme
```

`--theme` will run the theme changer function. It will list all the themes that are available and ask you to choose one of them.
