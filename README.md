# today

**Add Tasks, reserve time for them, Mark Tasks as Done and Be Organised!**

How is is different from a program such as [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)? **Taskwarrior** is a powerful to do list, whereas **today** is a day planner. You can use Taskwarrior to add tasks, make them recurring and add due dates; you can use today to plan what tasks you will be doing today, when you will do them and how much time you are planning to spend on them.

Today is still a **Work in Progress**.
