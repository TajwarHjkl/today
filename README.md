# today

**Add Tasks, reserve time for them, Mark Task Done and Be Organised!**

How is it different from a program such as [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)? **Taskwarrior** is a powerful to do list manager, whereas **today** is a day planner. You can use Taskwarrior to add tasks, make them recurring and add due dates; you can use today to plan what tasks you will be doing today, when you will do them and how much time you are planning to spend on them.

**today** is still a **Work in Progress**.
