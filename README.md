# today

Add Tasks, reserve time for them, Mark Tasks as Done and Be Organised!

How is different from a program like [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)? Taskwarrior is a powerful to do list whereas **today** is a day planner/scheduler. You can use Taskwarrior to add tasks, make them recurring, add due dates; you can use today to plan what tasks you will be doing today, when you will do them and how much time you are planning on spending on them.
